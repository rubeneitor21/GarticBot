# GarticBot
A WIP Gartic Phone Bot

# Install and Usage
1. Install NodeJS
2. Download repo zip or clone it
3. Run `npm i` to install dependencies
4. Get a lobby url
5. run `node main.js <url> <image url (optional and WIP)> <nickname (optional)>` leaving image url blank will draw "Rubeneitor2", notice most of images wont work and new default will be added (or not) in the future
6. When the game starts, you will need to type. DONT move the mouse while its drawing as it will likely mess it up
7. It will only draw once

## Issues
As of 25/03/2023 some images will not be fully drawn, even if they look finished and the ready button has been checked, some test may suggest it has to be with clicks and/or speed of the cursor when drawing. Feel free to open an issue if you have any suggestions or any other issue and solution for any of the stated ones
